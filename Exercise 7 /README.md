# Assessment Task 7: Netflix Userbase Analysis
# Objective:
Leverage linear regression to predict Monthly Revenue and logistic regression to classify customers based
on a positive or negative feedback proxy, using the Netflix Userbase dataset. This task will encompass
data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.
# Dataset:
"Netflix Userbase.csv", containing user demographics, subscription details, and other relevant
information.
# Requirements:
## Part 1: Data Preprocessing
* Load the Dataset: Import the dataset using Pandas and display its structure.
* Missing Values: Identify and manage any missing values appropriately.
* Encode Categorical Variables: Transform categorical variables into numerical representations
suitable for regression analysis.
* Feature Selection: Decide which features to include in the regression models. Explain your choice.
  
## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Descriptive Statistics: Provide a summary of the data using the .describe() method.
* Visualizations: Create visualizations (e.g., distribution of Monthly Revenue, user demographics)
to understand the data better.

## Part 3: Linear Regression Model (Predicting Monthly Revenue)
* Build the Model: Develop a linear regression model to predict the Monthly Revenue based on
selected features.
* Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model using R-squared, RMSE, or other relevant metrics.


## Part 4: Logistic Regression Model (Predicting Customer Feedback)
* Model Building: Assuming a binary feedback variable (positive/negative), construct a logistic
regression model to predict feedback based on user demographics and subscription details.
* Evaluation: Use accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the confusion matrix for model
assessment.

## Part 5: Comparative Analysis and Visualization
* Feature Importance: Examine the significance of different features in both regression models.
* Insights: Draw insights from the models' predictions, focusing on how various factors might
influence Monthly Revenue and feedback.

# Evaluation Criteria:
* Completeness and Correctness: All parts of the task must be completed accurately, following data
science best practices.
* Code Quality and Comments: The code should be well-organized, commented, and easy to
follow.
* Insightfulness: Demonstrated ability to extract meaningful insights from the analysis and model
results.
* Presentation: Effectively communicate findings through visualizations and summaries.
This task is designed to test practical knowledge of linear and logistic regression, as well as data
manipulation, visualization, and analytical skills in a real-world-like scenario. It offers a hands-on
experience with a dataset that includes user demographics, subscription details, and revenue information,
providing a comprehensive overview of data science applications in customer behavior analysis.
