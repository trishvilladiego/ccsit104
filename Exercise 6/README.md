# Assessment Task 6: Predicting Feedback on Online Food Orders Using Logistic Regression
## Objective:
Develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer feedback (positive/negative) on online food orders. This task involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## Dataset:
You will use a dataset that contains information on online food orders, including customer demographics,
order details, and feedback. The dataset includes features like Age, Gender, Marital Status, Occupation,
Monthly Income, and Feedback.

# Requirements
## Part 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing
1. Load the Dataset: Import the dataset using Pandas and display the first few rows to understand
its structure.
2. Handle Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset. Choose an
appropriate strategy (e.g., imputation or removal) based on the context.
3. Encode Categorical Variables: Convert categorical variables into a numeric format suitable for
logistic regression. Consider techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. Feature Selection: Identify which features to include in the model. Justify your selections based
on the dataset's context and preliminary analysis.

## Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Descriptive Statistics: Use .describe() to summarize the numeric columns. Highlight any
interesting findings.
2. Visualizations: Create visualizations to understand the relationships between features and the
target variable. Suggestions include:
* Distribution of Age and its impact on Feedback.
* Proportions of Feedback across different levels of Monthly Income.
* Correlation matrix heatmap to identify any interesting correlations between features.


## Part 3: Logistic Regression Model
1. Build the Model: Implement a logistic regression model using scikit-learn. Split your data into
training and test sets to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Model Evaluation: Assess your model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy,
precision, recall, and the confusion matrix. Discuss the results.

## Part 4: Data Analysis and Visualization
1. Feature Importance: Analyze and visualize the importance of different features in your logistic
regression model. Discuss how each feature influences the prediction of Feedback.
2. Prediction Insights: Visualize the distribution of predicted probabilities. Discuss any patterns or
insights you can derive from how the model makes predictions.

## Evaluation Criteria
* Completeness and Correctness: All parts of the task are completed correctly, following data
science best practices.
* Code Quality and Comments: The code is well-organized and commented, making it easy to
follow your analysis process.
* Insightfulness: Demonstrates the ability to extract meaningful insights from the analysis and
model results.
* Presentation: Effectiveness in communicating findings through visualizations and summary.
This task is designed to assess skills in handling a real-world data science problem, from initial data
preprocessing to deriving insights from a logistic regression model. It tests practical knowledge of logistic
regression in Python, along with data manipulation, visualization, and analytical skills.
