        <h2>Exercise 5 - Linear Regression</h2>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and account information using logistic regression.</p>
        <h3>Dataset:</h3>
        <p>Imagine we have a dataset named bank_customers.csv with the following columns:</p>
        <p>Dataset: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kidoen/bank-customers-data">bank_customers.csv</a></p>
    </section>
    <section id="exercise-6">
        <h2>Exercise 6 - Logistic Regression</h2>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>Develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer feedback (positive/negative) on online food orders. This task involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.</p>
        <h3>Dataset:</h3>
        <p>You will use a dataset that contains information on online food orders, including customer demographics, order details, and feedback. The dataset includes features like Age, Gender, Marital Status, Occupation, Monthly Income, and Feedback.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="exercise-7">
        <h2>Exercise 7 - Netflix Userbase Analysis</h2>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>Leverage linear regression to predict Monthly Revenue and logistic regression to classify customers based on a positive or negative feedback proxy, using the Netflix Userbase dataset. This task will encompass data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.</p>
        <h3>Dataset:</h3>
        <p>"Netflix Userbase.csv", containing user demographics, subscription details, and other relevant information.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="exercise-8">
        <h2>Exercise 8 - Pollution Data Time Series Analysis Using ARIMA</h2>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>The goal of this assessment is to simulate a time series dataset representing a country's annual pollution levels over a decade. You will apply time series analysis techniques, including the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to understand the data's behavior, test for stationarity, and forecast future pollution levels.</p>
        <h3>Dataset:</h3>
        <p>Simulate a time series dataset for a country's annual pollution levels over 10 years. Assume a trend component, a seasonal component, and some random noise in the data.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="midterm">
        <h2>Midterm - Forecasting with ARIMA Model</h2>
        <h3>Objective:</h3>
        <p>To apply ARIMA modeling techniques to forecast the number of app updates in the Google Play Store for the next 12 months based on historical data.</p>
        <h3>Dataset:</h3>
        <p>Google Play Store Dataset</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Description:</strong> Contains information about the google play store.</li>
            <li><strong>Use Case:</strong> Ideal for time series analysis to predict continuous outcomes like the downloads based on various features (e.g., ratings, reviews, installs).</li>
        </ul>
