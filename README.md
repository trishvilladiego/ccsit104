# Exercise 5 - Linear Regression
## Objective: 
Predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit based on their demographic and account information using logistic regression.
## Dataset:
Imagine we have a dataset named bank_customers.csv with the following columns:

# Exercise 6 - Logistic Regression
## Objective:
Develop a logistic regression model to predict the customer feedback (positive/negative) on online food orders. This task involves data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.
## Dataset:
You will use a dataset that contains information on online food orders, including customer demographics, order details, and feedback. The dataset includes features like Age, Gender, Marital Status, Occupation, Monthly Income, and Feedback.

# Exercise 7 - Netflix Userbase Analysis
## Objective:
Leverage linear regression to predict Monthly Revenue and logistic regression to classify customers based on a positive or negative feedback proxy, using the Netflix Userbase dataset. This task will encompass data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, evaluation, and visualization.
## Dataset:
"Netflix Userbase.csv", containing user demographics, subscription details, and other relevant information.

# Exercise 8 - Pollution Data Time Series Analysis Using ARIMA
## Objective:
The goal of this assessment is to simulate a time series dataset representing a country's annual pollution levels over a decade. You will apply time series analysis techniques, including the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model, to understand the data's behavior, test for stationarity, and forecast future pollution levels.
## Dataset:
Simulate a time series dataset for a country's annual pollution levels over 10 years. Assume a trend component, a seasonal component, and some random noise in the data.

# Midterm - Forecasting with ARIMA Model
## Objective:
To apply ARIMA modeling techniques to forecast the number of app updates in the Google Play Store for the next 12 months based on historical data.
## Dataset:
Google Play Store Dataset
â€¢ Description: Contains information about the google play store.
â€¢ Use Case: Ideal for time series analysis to predict continuous outcomes like the downloads based on various features (e.g., ratings, reviews, installs).
